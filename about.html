<p>Luxury I could actually afford.
"I wanted to treat my partner to a special weekend away but was on a budget. Hotel Haven was the perfect find. The room looked like it belonged in a high-end magazine, but the bill didn't give me a heart attack. It’s amazing to know a place this nice was established recently because the facilities feel so fresh and modern."
